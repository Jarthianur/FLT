<p>VFR-B := VirtualFlightRadar-Backend</p>
<p>This project is intended to be an interface between APRS-/ADS-B-receivers, wind-sensors and XCSoar and the airfield manager
    respectively.
</p>
<p>The aim is to provide a powerful backend-service, which receives position reports broadcasted by aircrafts via FLARM or ADS-B,
    alongside climate information, and finally sending NMEA reports to any client. These reports may be displayed by any
    aviation-purposed navigation application, supporting NMEA protocol. The well-known, free glider navigation tool
    <a href="https://www.xcsoar.org/" class="a">XCSoar</a> is recommended as such, as it supports all features provided by
    the VFR-B and is also available for most common platforms.</p>
