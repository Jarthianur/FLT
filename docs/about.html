    <h2>About</h2>
    <h3>The core functionalities of the VFR-B are:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>receive and parse APRS messages from APRSC (FLARM reports)</li>
      <li>receive and parse ADS-B messages, transcoded into SBS, from any SDR (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/antirez/dump1090" class="a">Dump1090</a>)</li>
      <li>receive and parse NMEA messages from any wind-sensor, integrated in the network (WIMWV, WIMDA)</li>
      <li>keep track of and manage detected aircrafts, normalizing measuring units</li>
      <li>serve these information as NMEA sentences on the network</li>
    </ul>
    <p>APRSC := APRS server coupled with a SDR, e.g. utilized by <a href="http://wiki.glidernet.org/" title="Open Glider Network" class="a">OGN</a><br>      SDR := Software Defined Radio</p>
    
    <h2>What are the benefits</h2>
    <p>The greatest benefit may be, that it assists an airfield manager to survey surrounding traffic. Also having real-time
      wind information, much more accurate than a windsock, is a great benefit too. But it is also useful for pilots waiting,
      on the ground, for a good moment to start, or to observe their comrades. Although, <strong>this system is no replacement for airspace surveilance!</strong>      Nevertheless detecting (E-)planes before they cross a winch-start in low altitude, or any other imaginable scenario,
      may increase safety and prevent some or other dangerous situations.</p>
    
    <h2>The whole system</h2>
    <p><strong>VFR-B is a standalone backend module. To make it to be of use, working installations of, or access to any APRS server,
ASDB-to-SBS decoder and network serving wind-sensor are required.</strong> Module means one can replace each component with
      whatever liked, unless it fits to the interfaces.</p>
    <p>VFR-B is, for example, used in <a href="https://github.com/rueckwaertsflieger/AMVR" class="a">AMVR</a>.</p>
   
    <h2>What about privacy</h2>
    <p>One aim of VFR-B is to stay, as much as possible, independent from the outside world/internet. This means no aircraft-,
      wind reports, or whatever is going to be sent to the internet directly.
      <strong>But this depends on how one will use this service.</strong> Of course, one can configure it to receive APRS
      from public OGN servers, but to keep track of local traffic, the traffic information must be sent to OGN first. Also
      the internal NMEA server will send its data to <em>localhost</em>, which means, everybody, inside the local network,
      is able to fetch it. It is also possible to make the machine, which runs the VFR-B, accessible to the public.</p>
